# AppliedTimeSeries
This repository contains material (slides, data, code) for the Applied Time Series course on YUNIKARN. The course covers the following topics:
- Unit 0: Mathematical toolkit
- Unit 1: Time series analysis and forecasting
- Unit 2: ARIMA and seasonality
- Unit 3: Intervention analysis
- Unit 4: Vector autoregression (VAR)
- Unit 5: Cointegration and VECM
- Unit 6: Modelling conditional volatility
- Unit 7: Structural breaks
- Unit 8: Panel VAR and cointegration

# V1: Applied Time Series: Course Overview
This video introduces the playlist "Applied Time Series", which covers deterministic time series models, stochastic processes, ARIMA, VAR, and structural breaks among other topics. We briefly highlight the main purpose of time series analysis: forecasting - and inherent limitations.

# V2: Deterministic Time Series Models
This video introduces deterministic time series models using data on food price inflation from the ONS (link on GitHub). I show you how to import the data into Stata and convert a string into a date variable. We discuss in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting. Using regression models, we fit a linear time trend and add high-order terms. Forecasts perform well in-sample - but not out-of-sample.
